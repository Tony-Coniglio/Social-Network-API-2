# Social-Network-API-2

This is the backend that could potentially be used for a basic Social Network. The API allows users to complete a number of actions that are expected of a social network, including creating and deleting user accounts, adding and removing friends of those accounts, posting and deleting comments (thoughts), and posting and deleting reactions to those thoughts. 

## Technology Used

This API was created using JavaScript, Mongoose, MongoDB, Express.js, and Node.js

## Installation

`npm install`

`npm start`

Testing done in Insomnia

## Contributors

This project was created by Tony Coniglio with the help of his tutor throught the Coding Bootcamp at The University of Texas.

## Version 2

The original version had too many errors, so I needed a fresh start. After creating version 2, I was able to use what worked from version 1 and make the appropriate adjusments to get the API working.
